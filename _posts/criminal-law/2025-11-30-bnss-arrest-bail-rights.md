<h1>BNSS 2023: Citizens’ Arrest, Custody & Bail Rights Explained</h1>

<p>
With the passage of <strong>Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)</strong>, India’s criminal justice framework has undergone one of its biggest overhauls in decades.  
It is crucial for every citizen — accused, victim or bystander — to understand what has changed when it comes to arrest, police custody, bail and procedural safeguards.

<h2>✅ What is BNSS 2023?</h2>

<p>
BNSS 2023 replaces older laws like CrPC and updates procedures around investigation, arrest, custody, bail and evidence. Its objective is to streamline and modernize criminal justice — but also to safeguard civil liberties. 1

<h2>👮 Arrest & Custody: What’s Different Under BNSS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Police can hold suspect in custody for up to <strong>15 days</strong> before judicial custody review — but extended limits have stricter checks. 2</li>
  <li>Hathkadi (handcuffs) or other restraint use is regulated — blindfolding or physical humiliation strictly disallowed in normal cases. 3</li>
  <li>After arrest, suspect must be presented before a magistrate within <strong>24 hours</strong> (or earliest possible). Delay may render custody invalid.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>🔓 Bail Rights: Jail is Exception, Not Rule</h2>

<p>
BNSS emphasizes that bail must remain the norm in non-serious offences; judicial discretion and fair assessment of risk (flight, tampering, violence) remain primary. 4  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presumption of innocence continues — mere accusation is not guilt. </li>
  <li>Even under BNSS, first-time or less-serious offence accused generally qualify for bail. </li>
  <li>Court’s duty: ensure timely hearing & fair bail, especially for those under long police custody. </li>
</ul>

<h2>🎯 Practical Advice: What You Should Do If Arrested / FIR Filed</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Calm down — ask for written FIR / arrest memo / reason for arrest.</li>
  <li>Record date/time, name of arresting officers, any witnesses, evidence of your behavior.</li>
  <li>Immediately demand to be produced before a magistrate. Delay may weaken police custody legitimacy.</li>
  <li>Hire a lawyer early — knowledgeably draft bail application, challenge unnecessary custody or harsh restraints.</li>
  <li>Avoid posting on social media about the case impulsively; maintain privacy.</li>
</ol>

<h2>📚 Why Every Citizen Should Read This</h2>

<p>
BNSS 2023 may increase police powers — but also brings structural safeguards.  
Aapko apne fundamental rights pata hone chahiye — warna aap vulnerable ho sakte hain.  
Ignorance is not an excuse; awareness is the best defense.
