      "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Maintenance under Indian law is a social welfare mechanism intended to protect a wife from financial abandonment. Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (now Section 144 BNSS, 2023) ensures that a wife who is unable to maintain herself is provided financial support by her husband.</p><p>This provision is not punitive. Courts have consistently held that maintenance exists to preserve dignity and prevent destitution.</p><h2>What Is Maintenance Under Section 125 CrPC?</h2><p>Maintenance is a monthly financial allowance ordered by a Magistrate to enable a wife to meet her basic needs. It applies irrespective of religion and personal law, making it one of the most effective remedies available to women in India.</p><blockquote><p><em>Maintenance is not charity; it is a legal obligation flowing from marriage.</em></p></blockquote><h2>Who Can Claim Maintenance?</h2><p>The term “wife” includes a legally married wife, a divorced wife who has not remarried, and a wife living separately for valid reasons such as cruelty, neglect, or desertion.</p><p>Maintenance may be denied if the wife is living in adultery, has remarried, or refuses to live with the husband without sufficient cause.</p><h2>Can a Working or Educated Wife Claim Maintenance?</h2><p>Yes. Indian courts have clarified that education or employment alone does not disqualify a wife from claiming maintenance. The court examines income disparity, standard of living during marriage, and the wife’s ability to sustain herself with dignity.</p><p>A wife earning a modest income may still receive maintenance if the husband’s income is substantially higher.</p><h2>How Is the Amount of Maintenance Decided?</h2><p>There is no fixed formula. Courts usually grant 20–30% of the husband’s net monthly income. Factors considered include:</p><ul><li>Husband’s income, assets and lifestyle</li><li>Wife’s reasonable needs</li><li>Children’s education and medical expenses</li><li>Inflation and cost of living</li></ul><h2>From Which Date Is Maintenance Payable?</h2><p>Maintenance may be awarded from the date of application or the date of order. The prevailing judicial trend favours granting maintenance from the date of application to discourage deliberate delays.</p><h2>What If the Husband Hides Income?</h2><p>Courts mandate disclosure of income affidavits, bank statements and tax returns. If income is concealed, the court may estimate income and draw adverse inference, often resulting in higher maintenance.</p><h2>Consequences of Non-Payment</h2><p>If a husband fails to comply with a maintenance order, the court may attach salary, seize property, issue arrest warrant, and order imprisonment up to one month per default.</p><h2>Supreme Court Guidelines</h2><p>In <strong>Rajnesh vs Neha</strong>, the Supreme Court laid down uniform guidelines requiring mandatory income disclosure, avoidance of overlapping orders and timely disposal of maintenance cases.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Section 125 CrPC remains one of the strongest legal protections for wives in India. Courts today balance fairness with firmness, ensuring genuine claims are protected while discouraging misuse.</p><p><strong>Need professional legal guidance?</strong><br><a href=\"https://justicefirms.com/contact\">Book a confidential consultation with JusticeFirms</a></p>"
